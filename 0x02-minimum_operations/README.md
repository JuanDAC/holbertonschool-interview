## Tasks
### 0. Minimum Operations
          Level: -1                    Auto review           Progress vs Score  Task Body In a text file, there is a single character   ` H `  . Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file:   ` Copy All `   and   ` Paste `  . Given a number   ` n `  , write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly   ` n `   ` H `   characters in the file.
* Prototype:  ` def minOperations(n) ` 
* Returns an integer
* If  ` n `  is impossible to achieve, return  ` 0 ` 
Example:
 ` n = 9 ` 
 ` H `   =>   ` Copy All `   =>   ` Paste `   =>   ` HH `   =>   ` Paste `   =>  ` HHH `   =>   ` Copy All `   =>   ` Paste `   =>   ` HHHHHH `   =>   ` Paste `   =>   ` HHHHHHHHH ` 
Number of operations:   ` 6 `
